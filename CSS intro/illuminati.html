    <h1>Illuminati</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Illuminati (/ɪˌluːmɪˈnɑːti/; plural of Latin illuminatus, 'enlightened') is a name given to several groups,
        both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era
        secret society founded on 1 May 1776 in Bavaria, today part of Germany. The society's goals were to oppose
        superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power.

    <p>
        Many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of
        Brunswick and the diplomat Franz Xaver von Zach, who was the Order's second-in-command.[3] It attracted literary
        men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning Duke of Gotha and of
        Weimar.[4]

    <p>
        In subsequent use, "Illuminati" has been used when referring to various organisations which are alleged to be a
        continuation of the original Bavarian Illuminati (though these links have not been substantiated). These
        organisations have often been accused of conspiring to control world affairs, by masterminding events and
        planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain political power and influence and to establish
        a New World Order.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>
        Adam Weishaupt (1748–1830) became professor of Canon Law and practical philosophy at the University of
        Ingolstadt in 1773. He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order Pope
        Clement XIV had dissolved in 1773.
    </p>
    <h3>Transition</h3>
    <p>
        Having, with difficulty, dissuaded some of his members from joining the Freemasons, Weishaupt decided to join
        the older order to acquire material to expand his own ritual. He was admitted to lodge "Prudence" of the Rite of
        Strict Observance early in February 1777.
